#_README for Vowel Replacement/Guess The Phrase_#
###Created by Noah Kittleson###

##**Description**##
This is a basic web app that takes whatever phrase you input, replaces the vowels with dashes, and allows someone else to guess what the original phrase was.  Great for breaking the ice at parties!

##**Setup**##
Clone the repository or otherwise download the source files to your computer.  Within the terminal navigate to the vowel-replacement file and run gradle.  This should set up a local server so that you can view the webpage on any modern browser at localhost:4567.
